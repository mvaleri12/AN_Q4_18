/* Hey Analyst,

	Bill is asking for a data pull to understand the following KPIs for Seagram's Branded Whiskey in 2014: 
	
	* Total Revenue
	* Total Profit
	* Total Profit Margin
	* Total Volume in Lieters sold
	
	He'd also like the above data grouped by county, sorted from highest revenue to lowest revenue county.
	
	Larry, the last analyst, left this code that pulled something similar. I'm not sure if it still works
	but it would be a great jumping off point. FYI, I'll be in Suncadia with my family so if you are lost
	maybe you could sync up with Valeri if you can't wrap your head around it. That'd be great. Thanks. */

/* Hey Red, Give me the top 10 stores in terms of sales for for 2014. I want them listed by store name. */

--0. Can we answer this question in a single table?

/* STEPS TO JOIN */

	--1. At least 2 tables, with at least 1 column/field in common

	--2. Column/field(s) tables have in common, MUST be same data type

	--3. The column/field in Table B should be unique, otherwise duplication will occur.

		-- Sample code to check for duplicate records in Table B.

			SELECT

			 STORE -- This is the column you'll be joining onto in Table B. Eg. customer_id.
			,COUNT(*) -- This counts the occurence of duplicates in column above.

			FROM STORES -- Table B goes here

			GROUP BY
			STORE  --Column you'll be joining onto in Table B.

			HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 --This returns the primary key records that only have duplicates.
									--If there is nothing in result output, then no duplicates for primary key. Clean join.
									--If there is records in result output, then duplicate values for primary key. Need to de-deup before JOINing.
