1. SQL Review (15 min)

	* What are the SQL keywords? What do they do?
	* Why are data-types so important?
	* Function review
		DISTINCT --> What does it do and where do you use it?
		TO_CHAR() -- What does it do and where do you use it?
		CAST() --> What does it do and where do you use it?
		UPPER() --> What does it do and where do you use it?
		LOWER() --> What does it do and where do you use it?
		LIKE --> What does it do and where do you use it?
		AS --> What does it do where do you use it?	
		
	* WHERE CLAUSE REVIEW
		
		1. 1 Condition, 1 column
		2. 2 Conditions, 1 Column
		3. Multiple Conditions, Multiple Columns (AND / OR)
		4. NULL VALUES
		5. RANGES
		
	<PRACTICE>	
	
	ASSESSMENT, MAKE THE CHART.
		
		
2. Finish Handout Aggregations and JOIN commands (1 hour)
	Do WHERE examples in practice

I want to see a total count of merchants, total offers, total GMS by marketplace name.	
	
SELECT
sum((cast(A.launch_offer_count_fba as INT) + A.launch_offer_count_mfn)) as TOTAL_OFFERS
,count(distinct A.merchant_id) as TOTAL_MERCHANTS
,sum(A.launch_day_gms) as TOTAL_LAUNCH_DAY_GMS
,ROUND(sum(A.launch_day_gms) / sum((cast(A.launch_offer_count_fba as INT) + A.launch_offer_count_mfn)),2) AS TOTAL_GMS_PER_OFFER
,A.marketplace_id
,B.MARKETPLACE_NAME

FROM LAUNCHES A

LEFT JOIN MARKETPLACE_DIM B ON A.MARKETPLACE_ID = B.MARKETPLACE_ID

WHERE
FBA_ENROLLED = TRUE AND MERCHANT_LAUNCH_GL <> 'Pets'

GROUP BY
A.MARKETPLACE_ID
,B.MARKETPLACE_NAME

ORDER BY 4 DESC
	

4. Extra Practice
Which products are not from vendor ‘Jim Beam Brands’?
SELECT * FROM products WHERE vendor_name!='Jim Beam Brands’;

>, >=
Which products are higher than 90 proof?
SELECT * FROM products WHERE CAST(proof as INT) > 90;

<, <=
Which products have a case cost of less than $60?
SELECT * FROM products WHERE case_cost < 60;

Please write queries that answer the following questions:
Which products have a case cost of more than $100?
Which tequilas have a case cost of more than $100?
Which tequilas or scotch whiskies have a case cost of more than $100?
Which tequilas or scotch whiskies have a case cost between $100 and $120?
Which whiskies of any kind cost more than $100?
Which whiskies of any kind cost between $100 and $150?
Which products, excluding tequilas, cost between $100 and $120?
